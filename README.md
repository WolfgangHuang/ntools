A collection of tools for office Excel use.

- Duplicate Finder: As the name suggests, but much more powerful and option-rich than Excel's standard feature
- Match & Assign: Developed to match reviews to reviewers, based on certain matching and exclusion criteria. Can basically be used for any matching purpose. Offers various options including fuzzy matching.
- Various smaller 1-click tools that allow to insert multiple rows, format numbers or apply certain CI colors.
- Sachkontenliste: A highly specific tool that converts "Sachkontenlisten" from Datev exports to a proper one-row-one-transaction format.

The first two tools may be of great use if you have a use case...
